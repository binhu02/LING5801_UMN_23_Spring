    "How hard is automatic part of speech tagging?  A recurring theme of the course is that one of the main challenges of NLP is dealing effectively with the ambiguity inherent to natural languages.  This is true for part-of-speech tagging, as well.  Many word forms occur with more than one part of speech label in a given corpus. For example, the word \"bank\" can be either a noun or a verb.\n",

    "We can use a part of speech tagged corpora to get a sense of the extent of this ambiguity by answering a few questions; for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How many word types are unambiguous in the sense that they occur with only one part of speech tag in the corpus?\n",
    "2. How many word types are ambiguous, that is, occur with two or more distinct part of speech tags in the corpus?\n",
    "3. How many of the individual tokens in the text are instances of (un)ambiguous word types?\n",

For example, we could build a dictionary that maps word forms to lists of the POS labels they occur with.  However, in order to answer the question about ambiguous *tokens*, we also need to know how often a word occurs with each of its associated part of speech labels.  Is there a single data structure we could use to answer all of the questions above?  \n",

Recall that a CFD associates an ordinary frequency distribution with each condition.  For our purposes, the objects associated with a word form will be a frequency distribution over the part of speech labels that occur with that form.  If we feed NLTK's `.ConditionalFreqDist()` class a list of tuples, it will return a conditional frequency distribution where the first element of each tuple is the condition and the second element is the observation for that condition.

    " - For each word form `w`, `cfd[w]` returns a frequency distribution over POS labels.  Try typing `cfd['back']` in the code block below.  By inspecting the resulting object you can see that the word form `back` occurs with four distinct parts of speech in our corpus: adverb (`RB`), singular common noun (`NN`), adjective (`JJ`), and base verb (`VB`).\n",
    " - The number of \"bins\" associated with a frequency distribution tells us how many POS labels a word form occurs with. The `.B()` method returns the number of bins associated with a frequency distribution.  Type `cfd['back'].B()` into the work space below.\n",
    " - The `.N()` method returns the total number of observations for a given condition.  Type `cfd['back'].N()` into the work space below.  This tells us how many times `back` occurred in the corpus.\n",
    " - `len(cfd)` tells you how many conditions are associated with the conditional frequency distribution, i.e. the number of unique word form types there were in the corpus.  Try it out in the space below.\n",
    " - `cfd.N()` returns the total number of word tokens in the corpus.  Again, try it out.\n",
